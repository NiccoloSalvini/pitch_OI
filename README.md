### Deployment:

Slides are hosted in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and can be
found in the upper right corner of the GitHUb page, or directly at
[textmining.netlify.app](https://textmining.netlify.app)

### Goal and Description:

These slides have been composed to orient stakeholders giving a
perspective on the effectiveness of the R language through its Text
Mining libraries (`Tidytext`, `textrecipes`, `{Tidymodels}`
`{Tidyverse}` stack. `ggplot2` and its extensions) as well as giving an
intuition on its graphical possibilities. They are written in Italian.
Main arguments treated are:

  - **Sentiment Analysis**

  - **tf-idf**

  - **n-grams**

  - **Topic Modeling**

  - **Network visualization (bigram)**

  - **Network flow visualization (trigram)**

  - **Text Machine Learning through the tidymodel stack**

Slides are made with `xaringan` and their style is managed through
`xaringanthemer` which generates a css stylesheet based on a function
arguments. Gggplot theme is coherently adapted to the style.
